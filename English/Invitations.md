#English--Invitations
Hello Everyone:  

I’m coming! We shared some awkward/outdated Chinese-style English last time. I sincerely hope you guys try to avoid those expressions and learn to speak some natural/native English in our daily communications.  
Next, I  have prepared some reference about “Invitation”. As you know, we usually invite others to do something. So I will introduce some useful expressions about “Inviting”, “Accepting Invitations” and “Declining Invitations ”.  Let’s get it on:  

**Inviting:**  
* Do you want to go to the movies tonight?
* Would you like to go to the theater tomorrow?
* Would you be interested in going to the stadium next Sunday?
* How do you fancy going to the restaurant for dinner?
* How about going to the movies?
* Care to come over for lunch?
* I was just wondering if you would like to come over for a drink.
* We'd be delighted to have you over for my birthday party.

**Accepting invitations:**
* Sure. What time?
* I'd love to, thanks.
* That's very kind of you, thanks.
* That sounds lovely, thank you.
* What a great idea, thank you.
* Sure. When should I be there?

**Declining invitations:**
* Sorry, I can't. I have to work.
* (I’m afraid that ) this evening is not good. I have an appointment.
* I'm busy tomorrow. Can I take a rain check on that? ( rain check: used to tell someone that you cannot accept invitations now, but would like to do so at a later time)
* That's very kind of you, but actually I'm doing something else this afternoon.
* Well, I'd love to, but I'm already going out to the restaurant.
* I'm really sorry, but I've got something else on.
* I really don't think I can , I'm supposed to be doing something else.

I wish you guys will try to practice inviting someone and simulate some situational dialogue as far as possible!    
**What do you expect next time? Please kindly share your suggestions and comments with me.**   
Thanks once again! Have a good week everyone!  

Best Regards and Many Thanks,
