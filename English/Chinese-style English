Hello guys:  
Great to meet you here. My name is James Wang, I’m from Chengdu,
Sichuan, and am a graduate student from Sichuan University.  
I like to make new friends, wish everyone to help each other and make
progress in this organization, which is significant and critical to
form a good English learning atmosphere.  
For the first time, I have prepared some common mistakes about
Chinese-style English usage, In my opinion, we should try to avoid
some awkward/outdated expressions in our daily life.  

1. How to spell it?  > How do you spell it?

2. What a pity! > What a shame!

3. My English is very poor. > My English isn't very good. 

4. Is it delicious? > Is it good?

5. I am a local Shanghainese. > I am from Shanghai or I'm local. 

6. The price is very suitable for me. >The price is right.  
   `Note`: suitable--- One of the most common usage is to appear in the form of negation on the notice. Eg: The following programme is not suitable for children. 

7. What's your job? > Are you working at the moment? /What kind of
work are you?  
   `Note`: Because if your conversation partner has just unemployment, so the question asked directly will embarrassing. So, the following statements is more polite: Are you working at the moment? Where are you working these days?/ What line of work are you in?
　　
8. How tink I can't. > I don't think I can.  
      
12. I don't dance well too. > I am not a very good dancer either.  
    `Note`: When we want to say we are not good at doing something, usually we speak “not good at something”.

13. What time is it now? > What time is it, please?  
    `Note`: We don’t say “What time was it yesterday?/What time is it tomorrow?” Sometimes, we say “How are we doing for time?”, which is particularly appropriate when time limitation.

14. My English is poor. >I am not 100% fluent, but at least I am
    improving.  
    `Note`: The similar as below: I am still having a few problem, but I am getting better.

15. Would you like to join our party on Friday? > Would you like to
    come to our party on Friday night?  
    `Note`: Join often refers to join a club or association, eg: join a health club/join the Communist Party. In fact, party often pair with come/go, eg: go a wild party/come to a Christmas Party.

16. I have no experience. > I don't know much about that.  
    `Note`: The similar as below: I am not really an expert in this area.

17. -Will you be going back home for the Spring Festival?  
    -of course! > Sure. / Certainly.  
    `Note`: Typically, only in answer to some well-known problems say “of course.”, so it is better say “sure/certainly”.

18. His body is  very healthy. > He is very healthy./He is in very good health.

19. Your eyes are similar to me. > your eyes are similar to my eyes./ your eyes are similar to mine.

20.  -- How are you?  
     -- I’m fine, and you? > I’m pretty good. How about you? / I’m
     great. What about you?
