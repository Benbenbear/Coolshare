Hello Everyone:

I’m coming! Welcome to our English communication family. I have shared some popular acronyms last time, did you practice them in your daily communication with your coworkers/friends?
I met a foreigner on the weekend and he was lost, so he asked me for help. If you  encounter a similar situation, how would you do it? Correspondingly, I will share some referral with you in this topic.
Let’s begin:  
**1. Basic vocabulary:**
* East 
* South
* West
* North
* Left
* Right
* Straight on
* Front
* Back
* First left/right
* One-way street
* Two-lane traffic
* Fork road
* Intersection  

**2. Asking directions:**
* Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the bus station/metro station/subway station/underground station?
* Excuse me, do you know where the post office is?
* Sorry to trouble you, but could you please direct me to the museum?
* Excuse me, Sir, but could you show me the way to the museum?
* Excuse me, how do I get to the airport?
* Excuse me, Is there a bar nearby?
* I’m looking for … (the address).

* How far is the museum, please?

**3. Giving directions:**

* You’ll pass a supermarket on your right.
* It’ll be straight ahead of you/on your right/on your left.
* If you follow these directions, you won’t have any trouble.

**4. Sample situation dialogue：** 
 A: Excuse me, Where am I on this map?
 B: We are here, bus station, we are in the heart of the city.
 A: Oh ! I think I’m lost. Can I go from here to the railway station?
 B: Head straight up the street about two blocks then turn left.

 A: Excuse me. I’m afraid I got lost. Can you show me the way to the station?
 B: I’m walking that way. Let me lead you the way.

 A: Excuse me. I wonder if you could help me. I’m looking for the Museum.
 B: Boy, you are lost. It’s across town.
